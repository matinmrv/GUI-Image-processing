# GUI-Image-processing

### Task
This project was assigned for the Image processing course which I took last semester.
The goal was to design a simple GUI that does different kinds of filtering and other stuff on the image.

### General
I used OOP with my home made filters with the help of `tkinter` library. It was pretty fun working with it. It has a lot of power. I used simple features for the GUI but I will come back to this later and probably coding a better one.:)
